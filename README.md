# The Almost Final Countdown

## Description

The Almost Final Countdown is a simple React game in which players start a timer and try to stop it when they estimate that the time is (almost) up. This game usesÂ **React Refs** to manage the timer and **React Portals** to display a notification message when the game ends.

## Features

- Start the countdown with a button click.
- Stop the timer when you think time is up.
- A portal-based notification pops up when the game ends.
- Simple and engaging time estimation challenge.

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Hooks (`useState`, `useRef`)
- React Portals (`ReactDOM.createPortal`)

## How to Play

1. Click the **Start** button to begin the countdown.
2. Try to estimate when the countdown is about to end.
3. Click **Stop** to stop the timer.
4. If your timing is close, you'll receive feedback via a portal notification!
